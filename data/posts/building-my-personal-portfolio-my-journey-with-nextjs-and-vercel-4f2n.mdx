Hello Dev.to! Iâ€™m Zayano, a web developer, and Iâ€™d love to share a bit about my experience building my personal portfolio using Next.js and Vercel. In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the process of creating a portfolio that not only showcases my work but also leverages modern technologies. ðŸ˜Š Why I Chose Next.js for My Portfolio<br>
As a developer, I wanted my portfolio to not only look great but also perform efficiently and be globally accessible. Next.js was the perfect choice because:

Server-side rendering (SSR) allows for faster loading times.<br>
Static Site Generation (SSG) makes it easy to build and serve content quickly.<br>
Automatic routing for dynamic pages with minimal configuration.<br>
Full support for API routes, allowing for seamless backend integration.<br>
With Next.js, I was able to build a site that is fast, modern, and SEO-friendly without spending much time on boilerplate configuration.

Project: Building My Portfolio with Next.js and Vercel<br>
I wanted to build a website that didnâ€™t just showcase my projects but also gave me the chance to experiment with various modern features, such as:

Dynamic Routes for each project I work on.<br>
Serverless Functions to handle forms and APIs with Vercel.<br>
Pre-rendering to ensure every page loads quickly, improving user experience.<br>
Once I settled on Next.js, I used Vercel to deploy the site. Vercel made the deployment process incredibly simple:

Auto-deployment every time I push a change to GitHub.<br>
The use of Fluid Compute, which scales my site automatically depending on traffic.<br>
Features I Added<br>
Dark Mode ðŸŒ™<br>
Many users prefer dark mode, so I decided to add it using custom CSS properties and JavaScript for the toggle functionality.

Interactive Projects ðŸ’»<br>
I integrated CodeSandbox and GitHub Gists into my portfolio, allowing visitors to view and try out the source code of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

Responsiveness and Animations âœ¨<br>
I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the design is responsive across different devices. Additionally, I added small animations with Framer Motion to make interactions more engaging.

About Vercel and Fluid Compute<br>
On top of that, Fluid Compute from Vercel has been incredibly helpful in managing my site's infrastructure efficiently. With Fluid Compute, my portfolio automatically adjusts its server capacity based on incoming traffic, ensuring a smooth experience without manual configuration. This feature is perfect for my personal portfolio, as I donâ€™t have to worry about scalability or performance issuesâ€”it all runs seamlessly.

Why Is a Portfolio Important?<br>
For me, a portfolio is more than just a place to display projects; itâ€™s an opportunity to showcase my approach and philosophy as a developer. Itâ€™s where I can share my ideas, demonstrate technical skills, and most importantly, show my personality as a developer.

Every project on my portfolio is a small step in my journey toward becoming a better developer.

A Few Projects Iâ€™m Proud Of<br>
Project A: An e-commerce app built with React and Redux.<br>
Project B: A task management system using Firebase and Next.js.<br>
Project C: A personal website with modern UI/UX design.<br>

Conclusion<br>
Building a personal portfolio is not just about showcasing the work youâ€™ve done but also a way to keep learning and evolving. With technologies like Next.js and Vercel, Iâ€™m able to focus on the creative and technical aspects of building the site, without having to worry about infrastructure or scalability. Itâ€™s been a rewarding experience, and Iâ€™m excited to continue adding new projects to my portfolio!
